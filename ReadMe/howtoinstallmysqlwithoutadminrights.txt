**how to install mysql without admin rights//test by vanthong

Step1 : download mysql community server from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/   
       download Windows (x86, 64-bit), ZIP Archive
Step2 : Set up folder for MySQL
     1. cd c
 	mkdir mysql
	
     2. Extract downloaded MySQL folder into C:\mysql.
       copy inner “mysql-8.0.29-winx64” folder to C:\mysql. 	
     3.Create 2 more empty folders in C:\mysql:
    	1.mysqldata – You can name it anything, but this folder will be used to store all the MySQL data
    	2.logs – Again you can name anything, but we will keep logs in here.

Step3 : Create my.ini file to install MySQL
	create my.ini file in C:/mysql/mysql-8.0.29-winx64.
	//code:
	[mysqld]
	basedir = "C:/mysql/mysql-8.0.29-winx64"
	datadir = "C:/mysql/mysqldata"
	tmpdir="C:/mysql/logs"
	log-error = "C:/mysql/logs/mysql-server-1.log"
	#port = "5544"
	//
Step 4 : Run mysqld (MySQL SerVer)
        1. Open CMD, and change directory to C:\mysql\mysql-8.0.29-winx64\bin
        2. Run mysqld --initialize-insecure --user=root
        3.Now run mysqld

      Note:

      Last command – mysqld will not return cursor back and it means server is running.
      We have said --initialize-insecure as we are not using password.
      If you want to set password, then run below command instead:

       //mysqld --initialize --user=root --console

Step 5 : Run MySQL
	mysql -u root

	If you set password then run 
	//mysql -u root -p and then it will prompt you password.

Note: Change Password
	
MySQL 5.7.6 and later :
   ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
 
MySQL 5.7.5 and earlier :
	SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('NEW_USER_PASSWORD');
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
